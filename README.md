# Module 3 Challenge

In this Python challenge, we are asked to create a git repository named python-challenge. We have to create 2 folders for 2 different challenges inside this repository. Also, write Python Script using the given datasets to produce the desired output. Output must be printed in a different text file.

## PyBank

Folder PyBank contains 2 folders, Resources and analysis. Use the csv file, 'budget_data.csv' from the Resources folder and create a Python script to write output in a text file, 'budget_analysis.txt' in the analysis folder.

### To run the script

One way to run the Python script is to copy 'main.py' from the PyBank folder to a Visual Studio code editor and go to  Terminal and run the script from there.

Make sure that you run the script in the same directory where it is stored. The path will be shown at the top of the editor.

Use 'python main.py' code to run the script

This will create a new text file that contains the output in the analysis folder.
If there is already an output file in the analysis folder, make sure you delete that file, inorder to see a new output text file.

## PyPoll

For this challenge,open the PyPoll folder and use the csv file, 'election_data.csv' from the Resources folder. Create a Python script to write output in a text file, 'election_analysis.txt' in the analysis folder.

### To run the script

use the same method as above to run the Python script, main.py from the PyPoll folder. We will get the following output
